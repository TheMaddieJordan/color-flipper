# color-flipper

This project is from a youtube tutorial. This is a basic introduction for me to work with the DOM. 

The CSS file was already set up. This project is simply to learn how to set up javascript for the project.

With this project, I learned how to set up and use arrays within functions. I also learned about Math.floor and Math.random to select and pull random numbers from the array, and setting the number to a full number value.
